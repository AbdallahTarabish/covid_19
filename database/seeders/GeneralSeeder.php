<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of convalescent plasma with high
    IgG titers against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in older adult patients within
    72 hours after the onset of mild Covid-19 symptoms. The primary end point was severe respiratory disease,
    defined as a respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute or more, an oxygen saturation of less than 93% while the
    patient was breathing ambient air, or both. The trial was stopped early at 76% of its projected sample size
    because cases of Covid-19 in the trial region decreased considerably and steady enrollment of trial patients
    became virtually impossible.
