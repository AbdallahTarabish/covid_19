<h2>Abstract</h2>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Therapies to interrupt the progression of early coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) remain
    elusive. Among them, convalescent plasma administered to hospitalized patients has been unsuccessful, perhaps
    because antibodies should be administered earlier in the course of illness.

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of convalescent plasma with high
    IgG titers against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in older adult patients within
    72 hours after the onset of mild Covid-19 symptoms. The primary end point was severe respiratory disease,
    defined as a respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute or more, an oxygen saturation of less than 93% while the
    patient was breathing ambient air, or both. The trial was stopped early at 76% of its projected sample size
    because cases of Covid-19 in the trial region decreased considerably and steady enrollment of trial patients
    became virtually impossible.

<h2>Results</h2>
<p><span>A total of 160 patients underwent randomization. In the intention-to-treat population, severe respiratory disease developed in 13 of 80 patients (16%) who received convalescent plasma and 25 of 80 patients (31%) who received placebo (relative risk, 0.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.29 to 0.94; P=0.03), with a relative risk reduction of 48%.</span>
    A modified intention-to-treat analysis that excluded 6 patients who had a primary end-point event before
    infusion of convalescent plasma or placebo showed a larger effect size (relative risk, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.20 to
    0.81). No solicited adverse events were observed.

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Early administration of high-titer convalescent plasma against SARS-CoV-2 to mildly ill infected
    older adults reduced the progression of Covid-19. (Funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the
